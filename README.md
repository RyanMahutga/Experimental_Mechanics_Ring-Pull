To use these codes download all the files and place them in the same directory. 
Test the code is functioning using the sample dataset provided. 
The sample dataset should also provide a template for organizing the force-displacement data used by this code.
Be sure to modify the dimensions in SampleCalc.m for your particular application.

NOTE: Application of the proposed correction factors should be done independently and according to the guidelines listed in the paper, and is not a part of this fitting code.
This codes is designed only to fit the dataset to calculate average PK1 stress vs centerline engineering strain.
